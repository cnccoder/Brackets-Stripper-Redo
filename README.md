# Brackets-Stripper-Redo
UI Theme for Brackets.
I Modified the original [Brackets-Stripper](https://github.com/visualbam/Brackets-Stripper) to an cleaner version of it.
All credit goes to [visualbam](https://github.com/visualbam) for making this awesome theme :)
Useses modified version of [Monokai Dark Soda](https://github.com/rainje/Monokai-Dark-Soda) for syntax highlighting. For this to be seen properly you must install https://github.com/notasz/brackets-uitheming
